	<h1>Hello my name is Mari Shimamura!</h1>
		
	<p>
		I was born in London Ontario but I wasn't raised in here. I actually lived in Tokyo Japan for 6 years. I travel to Japan quite often and visit my family. I found this program from my friend's father that works at this campus! Thanks Craig ðŸ˜‹ I originally wanted to do Theatre Tech and work at concerts. Weird dream of mine, but I still have a dream to work with music one day. I like this program because I like the coding and creating aspect of businesses.
	  
	
		I currently work at the mall at Bluenotes as a supervisor. I live at home with my mom, my dog and I'm currently rescuing a squirrell. I absolutely love animals.
