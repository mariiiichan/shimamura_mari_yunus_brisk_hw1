	<h1>Hello my name is Mari Shimamura!</h1>
		
	<p>
		I was born in London Ontario but I wasn't raised in here. I actually lived in Tokyo Japan for 6 years. I travel to Japan quite often and visit my family. I found this program from my friend's father that works at this campus! Thanks Craig ðŸ˜‹ I originally wanted to do Theatre Tech and work at concerts. Weird dream of mine, but I still have a dream to work with music one day. I like this program because I like the coding and creating aspect of businesses.
	  
	
		I currently work at the mall at Bluenotes as a supervisor. I live at home with my mom, my dog and I'm currently rescuing a squirrell. I absolutely love animals.

		Hello my name is Brisk Yunus!
	</h1>
		<p>I was born in Edmonton but raised here in London, Ontario. I always loved being in London because although it's a small city it sure has a lot going for it. Companies and Studios are always growing and my future goal is to be a part of it! I currently work at American Eagle as a Jean Expert. I have a few hobbies but as of now I do a lot of photography in my spare time. I also do music production on the side and love to create instrumental music which I end up releasing on Spotify and Apple Music. This is just a small passion of mine but would love to get into design as a career whether it's image, video or even music.

			I took this program because media is something I've always been into and it's always interested me. I've also been doing a lot of concept art including a game my friend is currently working on.

	<h2><u> Things we have in common!</u></h2>
	<p> We both love playing Legend of Zelda. We both talked about how much we like playing the new game Breath of the Wild. </p>
		
	<p>	We both like Asian food. You can't go wrong with Asian food. What more can we say? </p>
		
	<p>	One of our favourite shows is Game of Thrones. We're both eagerly waiting for the next season.</p>
