		Hello my name is Mari Shimamura! 
	</p>
	<h1>
		I was born in London Ontario but I wasn't raised in here. I actually lived in Tokyo Japan for 6 years. I travel to Japan quite often and visit my family. I found this program from my friend's father that works at this campus! Thanks Craig ðŸ˜‹ I originally wanted to do Theatre Tech and work at concerts. Weird dream of mine, but I still have a dream to work with music one day. I like this program because I like the coding and creating aspect of businesses.
	  
	
		I currently work at the mall at Bluenotes as a supervisor. I live at home with my mom, my dog and I'm currently rescuing a squirrell. I absolutely love animals.

	<u> Things we have in common!</u>
	<h2> 
		We both love playing Legend of Zelda. We both talked about how much we like playing the new game Breath of the Wild. 
		We both like Asian food. You can't go wrong with Asian food. What more can we say?
		One of our favourite shows is Game of Thrones. We're both eagerly waiting for the next season.
